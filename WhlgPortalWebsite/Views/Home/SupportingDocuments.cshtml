    The referral system has two main elements:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a consumer facing service</li>
        <li>a data referral portal</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    Neither of these systems will replace your existing processes to deliver HUG2.
    It is instead another route for consumers to find government schemes and be connected to you. 
</p>

<img src="@(assetsPath)/her-roadmap.svg" alt="A roadmap showing the stages of the home energy retrofit process. The first stage,
'consumer service', is marked as completed; the next stage, 'referral portal', is highlighted; and the final two
stages are 'application verification' and 'home improvements'." />

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="consumer-service">Consumer service</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The consumer service is where applicants provide information to determine if they may be eligible for HUG2.
    The applicant will have provided:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>whether they own or rent their home</li>
        <li>their full address, which is used to check EPC, LSOA and Local Authority</li>
        <li>their income band</li>
        <li>whether their property has a gas boiler or not</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    All these answers are used to assess whether the applicant is likely to be eligible for the Home Upgrade Grant.
    Only applicants who are predicted to be eligible are referred to you. 
</p>
@(await Html.GovUkInsetText(new InsetTextViewModel
{
    Text = "Other government backed energy schemes will be integrated into this service in the future.",
}))
<p class="govuk-body">
    After applicants are shown their estimated eligibility status, they can provide their contact details to allow
    Local Authorities to contact them.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The consumer service is <strong class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">not</strong> for:
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Private tenants</li>
        <li>Social housing tenants</li>
        <li>Those who own their property via shared ownership scheme</li>
        <li>Landlords</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="referral-portal">Referral portal</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">
    The referral portal is for local authorities, delivery partners and/or consortia to receive applications.
    You will only be able to access applicants that are within your region based on postal code.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
    Applications will be grouped into monthly csv files and sorted by local authority area.
    The file for the current month will continually update.
    On the last day of the month a new file will begin overnight.
    All data from previous months can be accessed at any time.
